%% 
%   Improved Relational Fuzzy c-Means (iRFCM) is an extension on top of the
%   Relational Fuzzy c-Means (RFCM) proposed in [1]. Since RFCM is the
%   relational dual of Fuzzy c-Means (FCM), it expects the input
%   relational matrix R to be Euclidean. Otherwise, RFCM can fail to
%   execute due encountering negative relational distances. iRFCM attempts
%   to solve this problem by Euclideanizing R first before clustering.
%
% Usage: output = irfcm(R,c,options)
%   options is a struct with the following default values:
%
%       fuzzifier        = 2;
%       epsilon          = 0.001;   
%       maxIter          = 100;     
%       initType         = 2;       
%       gamma            = 0;       
%       delta            = [];
%
%   Explanation of those fields is provided below
%
% output    - structure containing:
%               U: fuzzy partition
%               V: cluster centers/coefficients
%               terminationIter: the number of iterations at termination
%               maxIter: maximum number iterations allowed
%
%             If you decide to Euclideniate R before running iRFCM, then the
%             following information will be returned as well
%               kruskalStress: the stress value measured the tranformed R
%               eps: the value that minimized the different between R and D
%               lambda: the smallest constant to add to R to make it Euclidean
%               D: The Euclideaniated matrix
%
% R         - the relational (dissimilarity) data matrix of size n x n
% c         - number of clusters
% fuzzifier - fuzzifier, default 2
% epsilon   - convergence criteria, default 0.0001
% initType  - initialize relational cluster centers V
%               1 = random initialization
%               2 = randomly choose c rows from D
% maxIter   - the maximum number fo iterations, default 100
% delta     - delta is the matrix that is used to tranform R to Euclidean
%               (See ref. [2-3])
%             delta is of size n x n and can be for instance
%                  delta = 1-eye(n)  this is the default delta
%                  delta = subdominant ultrametric matrix
%                  delta = R
%                  delta = power of R
%                  delta = log2(1+D), see [3], page 485
%                  delta = parametric function
%              delta is expected to have an Euclidean representation,
%              otherwise an error will be thrown (see [2])
% gamma     - use it only if you know in advance that this the value that
%             will Euclideanize R
